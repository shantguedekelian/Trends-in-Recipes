# **Trends-in-Recipes** 
by Shant Guedekelian
this is a project for DSC 80 at UCSD

# Introduction
What trends can we see in recipes over time? That is, are certain types of recipes becoming more popular? In this project I will explore whether **high protein** meals have risen in popularity. With so much information going around about the importance of protein, has this affected ___ (why should the reader care about if the number of protein recipes has increased? maybe because it tells them that protein has become more important to people, etc). 

The dataset that I am using contains **234,429 rows**, each corresponding to a review written about a recipe. In total there are **83,782 unique** recipes in my dataset. 

Some relevant columns are:
>**'submitted':** Date recipe was submitted.
>**'tags':** Food.com tags for recipe (gluten free, etc).
>**'nutrition':** Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value”.
>**'n_ingredients':** Number of ingredients in recipe.
>**'n_steps':** Number of steps in recipe.
>**'date':** Date when review was submitted.
